# BookItNow

Clean, elegant, static booking website prototype built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Features implemented:
- Hero search with destination, date range picker (modal), and guest counter
- Date-range selection (pick check-in then check-out)
- Client-side validation for required fields
- Responsive, card-based featured escapes
- Accessible labels and ARIA attributes

How to run locally:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a simple static server).

Optional: serve via a local static server (recommended for relative asset behavior):

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps:
- Add month navigation and multi-month calendar view
- Replace placeholder images with owned assets
- Add a deployment step (Netlify, GitHub Pages) and CI
- Push to a GitHub repository and enable Pages
